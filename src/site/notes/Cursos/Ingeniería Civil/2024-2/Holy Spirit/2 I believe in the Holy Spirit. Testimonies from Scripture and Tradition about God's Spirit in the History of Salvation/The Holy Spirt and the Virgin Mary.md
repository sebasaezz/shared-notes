# Introduction: Jesus is the Word

> [!quote] John 1, 1
> [1](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PX9.HTM#$3PZ) [2](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PX9.HTM#$3Q0) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

In this paragraph, Jesus is god, and we get the mystery of the holy trinity.

> [!quote] Pope Francis, _Regina Coeli_, April 28, 2013
> The Virgin Mary teaches us what it means to live in the Holy Spirit and what it means to accept the news of God in our life. 
> 
> She conceived Jesus by the work of the Holy Spirit, and every christian, each one of us, is called to accept the word of God, to accept Jesus inside of us and then to bring him to everyone. 
> 
> Mary invoked the Holy Spirit with the apostles in the upper room: we too, every time that we come together in prayer, are sustained by the spiritual presence of the mother of Jesus, in order to receive the gift of the Spirit and to have the strength to witness to Jesus risen.

# Fundamental concepts
Names of the Virgin Mary
- _Pneumatophora_ (_Pneuma_, Holy Spirit + _Phoros_, Carrie of)
	- The one that carries the Holy Spirit
	- We are all _pneumatophores_, but the Virgin Mary carries the Holy Spirit and Jesus in a grater way.
- Bride of the Holy Spirit
	- She conceived Jesus by the Holy Spirit
	- This is controversial, because it can make us think that the Holy Spirit is the father of Jesus, but that is not the case.
	- Tabernacle: A place that contains the presence of God.
	- ![Pasted image 20241030125924.png|200](/img/user/Cursos/Ingenier%C3%ADa%20Civil/2024-2/Holy%20Spirit/2%20I%20believe%20in%20the%20Holy%20Spirit.%20Testimonies%20from%20Scripture%20and%20Tradition%20about%20God's%20Spirit%20in%20the%20History%20of%20Salvation/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241030125924.png)
	- In churches, the places where the consecrated hosts are stored, are called tabernacles. 
		- This is done to keep the hosts in order to give them to sick people that can't go to church.
		- It is also done to adore in a physical way the presence of Jesus.
- Di-hypostatic union: She is in a relation between two persons, one of them is Her, and the other one is the Holy Spirit.
# Annunciation-Incarnation

> [!quote] Luke 1:30-35
> 30 The angel said to her, “do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 and now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. 32 he will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. 33 he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” 34 Mary said to the angel, “how can this be, since I am a virgin?” [A] 35 the angel said to her, “the Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born [b] will be Holy; he will be called son of God.

Mary is very relatied to the Holy Spirit because she became the mother of Jesus because of the action of the Holy Spirit.

# Visitation: She communicates the Holy Spirit

> [!quote] Luke 1:39-44
> 39 in those days Mary set out and went with haste to a judean town in the hill country, 40 where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. 41 when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth ==was filled with the Holy Spirit== 42 and exclaimed with a loud cry, “blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. 43 and why has this happened to me, that the Mother of my Lord comes to me? 44 for as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy.  

# Crucifixion
When Jesus died, Mary receives the Holy Spirit. 

> [!quote] John 19; 26-30
> 26 when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, “woman, here is your son.” 27 then he said to the disciple, “here is your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home. 
> 
> 28 after this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, He said (in order to fulfill the scripture), “I am thirsty.” 29 A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. 30 when Jesus had received the wine, he said, “it is finished.” Then he bowed his head and ==gave up his spirit==.

# Pentecost: Mary invokes the Holy Spirit

> [!quote] Pope Benedict XVI
> At Pentecost, the Virgin Mother appears again as the Bride of the Spirit exercising universal motherhood to all begotten by God through faith in Christ..

When does the universal motherhood starts? At Jesus' death.
