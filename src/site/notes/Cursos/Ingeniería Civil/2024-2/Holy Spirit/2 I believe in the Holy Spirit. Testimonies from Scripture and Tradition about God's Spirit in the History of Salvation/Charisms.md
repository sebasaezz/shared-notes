Gift vs grace:
- A grace is a gift that, when is for the good of other people is called charism.

Every charism has a purpose. 

# Welcoming charisms in faith

What if you don't accept a charism:
- It affects the common good

# Discernment
Charisms need to be discerned by the Church, maybe you think that you have a charism, but not really.

> It is in this sense that discernment of charisms is always necessary. No charism is exempt from being referred and submitted to the Church's shepherds. "Their office [is] not indeed to extinguish the Spirit, but to test all things and hold fast to what is good," so that all the diverse and complementary charisms work together "for the common good.”


# All charisms are centered in love

> ... They are a wonderfully rich grace for the apostolic vitality and for the holiness of the entire Body of Christ, provided they really are genuine gifts of the Holy Spirit and are used in full conformity with authentic promptings of this same Spirit, that is, in keeping with charity, the true measure of all charisms.."

- That is because ==the Holy Spirit is Love==, and charisms come from the Holy Spirit.
