# Figures from the old testament
## Burning bush

> [!quote] Exodus 3:1-6
> Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law jethro, the priest of midian; he led his  flock beyond the wilderness, and came to H oreb, the mountain of god. 2 there the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. 3 then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up.” 4 when the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, god called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!”  
> And he said, “here I am.” 5 then he said, “come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” 6 he said further, “I am the god of your father, the god of A braham, the god of I saac, and the god of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God

Between this and the following event, Moses goes to Egips and takes the people.

## Pillar of fire

> [!quote] Exodus 13:20-22
> 20 they set out from succoth, and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness. 21 the LORD went in front of them in a pillar of cloud by day, to lead them along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light, so that they might travel by day and by night. 22 neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people. 

Fire is life:
- Heat
- Life
- Protection from animals

## Fire comes down from heaven

> [!quote] Kings 18:20-39
> 20 So Ahab sent to all the israelites and assembled the prophets at mount Carmel. 21 E lijah then came near to all the people, and said, “how long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” The people did not answer him a word. 22 then E lijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets number four hundred fifty. 23 let two bulls be given to us; let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it; I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. 24 then you call on thename of your God and I will call on the name of the LORD; the God who answers by fire is indeed God.” All the people answered, “well spoken!”
> 
> 25 then Elijah said to the prophets of B aal, “choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many; then call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.” 26 so they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on the name of baal from morning until noon, crying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no answer. They limped about the altar that they had made. 27 at noon E lijah mocked them, saying, “cry aloud! Surely he is a God; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.” 28 then they cried aloud and, as was their custom, they cut themselves with swords and lances until the blood gushed out over them. 29 as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice, no answer, and no response.  
> 
> 30 then E lijah said to all the people, “come closer to me”; and all the people came closer to him. First he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down; 31 Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, “Israel shall be your name”; 32 with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. Then he made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed. 33 next he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, “fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” 34 then he said, “do it a second time”; and they did it a second time. Again he said, “do it a third time”; and they did it a third time,  
> 
> 35 so that the water ran all around the altar, and filled the trench also with water. 36 at the time of the offering of the oblation, the prophet Elijah came near and said, “o LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your bidding. 37 answer me, O LORD, answer me, so that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.” 38 then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and even licked up the water that was in the trench. 39 when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, “the LORD indeed is God; the LORD indeed is God.”  


Baal is a fake god, a demon. Ahab is a king that worships Baal.
This tells the story between the choice between Baal and God. E lijah is the last prophet of God.
To prove the existence of god, they agree to burn a bull (offering). Baal never answers, but God brings fire and burns even wet wood. 

# Christ wants to bring fire to the earth

> [!quote] Luke 12:49 and Matthew 3:11
> 49 “I came to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!  
> 11 “He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

We are called to love and to be loved. The fire is represents love, Jesus' love, and Christ wants to bring it down to earth.

# God is a Consuming Fire

> [!quote] Hebrews 12:28-29
> 28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, by which we offer to God an acceptable worship with reverence and awe; 29 for indeed our God is a consuming fire.

You will be consumed in love.

# Christ's Heart burns, His Blood like fire
Apparition in France to a nun in 1675. In the apparition, he had his heart out of his chest, and said.

> [!quote] 
> “Behold this heart, which has loved men so much, that it has spared nothing, even to exhausting and consuming itself, in order to testify to them its love; and in return I receive from the greater number nothing but ingratitude by reason of their irreverence and sacrileges, and by the coldness and contempt which they show me in this sacrament of love.”  
> (Jesus to St. Margaret Mary)
