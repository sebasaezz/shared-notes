- Economy of salvation:
	- The HS is the "another counselor" spreading the good news revealed by Jesus
	- The HS glorofies christ
	- The departure of Jesus was necessary to let the HS finish his work
## 2. Father, Son and Holy Spirit
### 8
- The three are called persons, they are distict but the form one another
- The relationship is perfect
- The Holy Spirit procedes from the father
	- It is sent in the name of the son

- The Father sent the HS and the Son, but as the power of the son for the redemption (dying)
	- Thus, the son ends up sending the HS
- This relationship of interdependence is _casual_.

- The Last supper is the highest point of revelation
	- Great missionary mandate:
		- Baptism
		- Inthe name of the father...
	- Reflection (and reveal) of the trinity
### 10
- God is love, the HS is personal love (love between the three persons).
- God pours his love through the HS (gift and _don_)
## 3. The salvific self-giving of god in the holy spirit
### 11
- En la última cena se revela la lógica de la salvación
	- Como una extención de la comunión del padre, hijo y hs.
	- This logis is transmitted through the HS too
