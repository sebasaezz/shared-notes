# The Intimate Relationship Between the Divine Persons: Unity and Distinction

> [!quote]
> "When the Father sends his Word, He always sends his **B**reath. In their joint mission, the Son and the Holy Spirit are distinct, but inseparable. To be sure, ==it is Christ who is seen==, the visible image of the invisible God, but it is the Spirit who reveals Him"
> (Catechism of the Catholich Church)

The Son and the HS are two different persons with two different missions that are joint together

The missions are different, but the work is the same (salvation).

Through Jesus you see God (Father).

God is revealing to is since the beginning of the world, but there is the highest point of revelation, when he revealed himself directly. 
	That is by the birth of Jesus, he said: "Who sees me, sees the father"

The two persons, Christ and the Holy Spirit are united, they are like the two hands of the father.

# The Image used by St. Irenaeus of Lyons

> [!quote]
> "The Lord God formed man out of the cay of the ground and blew int his mouth the breath of life, and so man became a living being"
Irenaeus created the metaphor of the son and Hs being the two hands of god. This the image:

1. Man was created directly by the hands of god
2. The hands of God are: Son and the Holy Spirit
3. The Son is the one who communicates the image to the clay, and teh Holy Spirit if the one who communicates the divine likeness
4. Each of the three divine persons in creation acts according to his personal qualities: the Father creates matter _ex nihilo_, the Son brings form and structure to it, and the Holy Spirit imbues it with life and dynamism. 

Every actions that happens outside of the trinity are trinitarian actions, done by every person.

# Two Different Mission, One only Work

“The whole divine economy is the common work of the three divine persons. For as the Trinity has only one and the same nature, so too does it have only one and the same operation”

"The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one principle." (council of Florence, 1442:DS 1331). "However, each divine person performs the common work according to his unique personal property" (council of Florence, 1442: DS 1331)
