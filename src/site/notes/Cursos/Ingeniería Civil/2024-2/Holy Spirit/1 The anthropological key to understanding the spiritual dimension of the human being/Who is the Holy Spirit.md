The holy spirit is one of the three persons, and he is god. In hebrew, the holy spirit is referred as **Ruah**, it is the fist way they talked about it in the old testament. 

They didn't know that it was a divine person, nor that there is a trinity. We know something about him because of the revelation in nature.

We came to know that the holy spirit was a divine person with the word of Jesus.

Ruah is translated into greek with the word Pheuma and the into latin with Spitirus. Finally in english with Spirit.

They all mean something like air and beathing.

# 1. The great unknow

The HS is the spirit of Jesus, the **Truth**

We recognize the exitance of the HS by the work he does to reveal the Word, and disposes us the receive the Word in faith.

The world does not know nor see the Holy Spirit, thus cannot receive him.

# 2. A divine person

The Holy Spirit is consubstantial with the Father and the Son (one with them). And at the same time is the gif of the Father to the world.

When Jesus died, he gave the world the Holy Spirit by blowing. And also when he resurected.

> At the beginning of the bible, the first divine person that appeared was the Holy Spirit.

The holy spirit is a divine person that is given to us

When the father sends his Word, he always sends his **breath**. ==The son and the holy spirit are distinct but inseparable==.

Jesus is the visible divine person. 

The Holy Spirit is a dynamic person, it moves things towards love.

# 3. Hypostatized love

> Hyposthesis means person in greek

God is love, the Father, HS and Jesus is love. But we atribute the personification of the love **given to us** as the Holy Spirit. 

What does Ruah means in the context of our class:

Ruah, in the context of the class, refers to the Holy Spirit as understood in the Hebrew Old Testament. It is associated with breath or wind, indicating a life-giving force. It signifies the presence and power of God. The term also underscores the dynamic and active nature of the Holy Spirit in enacting God's will and guiding believers towards love and truth.
