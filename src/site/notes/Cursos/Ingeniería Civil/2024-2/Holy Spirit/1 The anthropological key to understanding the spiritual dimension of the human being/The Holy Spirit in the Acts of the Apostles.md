## 2: 1-11 Pentecost

## 4: 23-31

> [!quote]
> 23. After their release they went back to their own people and reported what the chief priests and elders had told them.
> 24. And when they heard it, they raised their voices to God with one accord and said, "Sovereign Lord, maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them,
> 25. ==you said by the holy Spirit== through the mouth of our father David, your servant: 'Why did the Gentiles rage and the peoples entertain folly?
> 26. The kings of the earth took their stand and the princes gathered together against the Lord and against his anointed.'
> 27. Indeed they gathered in this city against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed, Herod [4](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXY.HTM#$40G) and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
> 28. to do what your hand and (your) will had long ago planned to take place.
> 29. And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and enable your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
> 30. as you stretch forth (your) hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done through the name of your holy servant Jesus."

## 5: 1-11 Ananias and Sapphira

This is why you don't joke about the Holy Spirit.

> [!quote]
> 1. [1](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXZ.HTM#$40J) A man named Ananias, however, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property.
> 2. He retained for himself, with his wife's knowledge, some of the purchase price, took the remainder, and put it at the feet of the apostles.
> 3. But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that you lied to the holy Spirit and retained part of the price of the land?
> 4. While it remained unsold, did it not remain yours? And when it was sold, was it not still under your control? Why did you contrive this deed? You have lied not to human beings, but to God."
> 5. When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last, and great fear came upon all who heard of it.
> 6. The young men came and wrapped him up, then carried him out and buried him.
> 7. After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, unaware of what had happened.
> 8. Peter said to her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?" She answered, "Yes, for that amount."
> 9. Then Peter said to her, "Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen, the footsteps of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
> 10. At once, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men entered they found her dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
> 11. And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.

At the begining of the Church, everything was shared. This couple (Ananias and Sapphira) the kept money  after selling land and **lied** about it (they could've kept the money, the problem was lying about it).

Ananias didn't lie to John and the church, they lied to the Holy Spirit (God).

After this, Ananias died (5) when the church realized (Peter). Sapphira died too.

Stephen dedicated his life to help poor people, specially widows (women were dependen of men).

Stephen was about to be stoned by the people (including Saul $\rightarrow$ Paul). In the moment of his death, Stephen was filled with the Holy Spirit.

> 18. [6](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PY2.HTM#$416) When Simon saw that the Spirit was conferred by the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money
> 19. and said, "Give me this power too, so that anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive the holy Spirit."
> 20. But Peter said to him, "May your money perish with you, because you thought that you could buy the **gift of God** with money.
> 21. You have no share or lot in this matter, for your heart is not upright before God.
> 22. Repent of this wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord that, if possible, your intention may be forgiven.
> 23. For I see that you are filled with bitter gall and are in the bonds of iniquity."

This is in Samaria, Simon is other Simon. He offered money for the Holy Spirit (Gift of God). La simonía es un pecado y trata de pedir dinero por algo divino dentro de la iglesia.

> 
> 5. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
> 
> 6. And when Paul laid (his) hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
