# Texts of the Holy Spirit in St. John
## The Spirit of God
### 1:32-33 Baptism of Jesus

> [!quote]
> 32 John (The baptizer) testified further, saying, "I saw the Spirit come down like a dove [24](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PX9.HTM#$3QM) from the sky and remain upon him.
> 33 I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'On whomever you see the Spirit come down and remain, he is the one who will baptize with the holy Spirit.'
### 3:5-8 Dialogue with Nicodemus

> [!quote]
> 5 Jesus answered, "Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.
> 6 What is born of flesh is flesh and what is born of spirit is spirit.
> 7 Do not be amazed that I told you, 'You must be born from above.'
> 8 The wind [4](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXB.HTM#$3RI) blows where it wills, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit."

When you get the spiritual life (baptism), you are born again.

### 3:34 Unmeasured Holy Spirit

> [!quote]
> For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God. He does not ration his gift [16](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXB.HTM#$3RU) of the Spirit.

The father gave an infinite amount of Holy Spirit to Jesus. 

### 4:23-24 The Samaritan woman

> [!quote]
> 23 But the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth; [9](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXC.HTM#$3S3) and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him.
> 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and truth."

### 6.63 The Spirit gives life

> [!quote]
> It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh [22](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXE.HTM#$3TD) is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.

### 7:37-39 He who thirsts

> [!quote]
> 37 [13](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXF.HTM#$3TQ) On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and exclaimed, "Let anyone who thirsts come to me and drink.
> 38 Whoever believes in me, as scripture says: 'Rivers of living water [14](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXF.HTM#$3TR) will flow from within him.'"
> 39 He said this in reference to the Spirit that those who came to believe in him were to receive. There was, of course, no Spirit yet, [15](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXF.HTM#$3TS) because Jesus had not yet been glorified.

## The Paraclete
Jesus named the Holy Spirit as Paraclete in the Gospel of john.
### 14:16-17 dwells in you

> [!quote]
> 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate [8](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXM.HTM#$3WR) to be with you always,
> 17 the Spirit of truth, [9](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXM.HTM#$3WS) which the world cannot accept, because it neither sees nor knows it. But you know it, because it remains with you, and will be in you.

The first use of the word Paraclete in the Bible. 
Why "Another"? 
Jesus was the first paraclete.

### 14.26 will teach and remember

> [!quote]
> The Advocate, the holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name - he will teach you everything and remind you of all that (I) told you.

The bible is inspired _in-spiritus_ by the Holy Spirit.
### 15.16 will testify

> [!quote]
> It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.

The Holy spirit procedes from the father and the son. As said in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan creed:

### 16.7 Jesus' departure was good

> [!quote]
> But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I go. For if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.

Why?
He will give us something that is similar to him (Holy Spirit) plus salvation.

### 16.13 will not speak on its own
> [!quote]
> [5](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXO.HTM#$3XE) But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth. He will not speak on his own, but he will speak what he hears, and will declare to you the things that are coming.
