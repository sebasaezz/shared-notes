# The Holy Spirit in the letters of Saint Paul

> [!quote]
> St. Paul reflects on the Spirit showing his influence not only on the Christian's actions but on his very being. In fact, he says that the Spirit of God dwells in us (cf. Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 3:16) and that "God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts" (Galatians 4:6)
> (Pope Benedict XVI, 11/15/2006)

The Holy Spirits had influence in his Actions and Being. It in not only an external thing, it acts in your heart.

> Finally, the Spirit, according to St. Paul, is a generous down payment that God himself has given us as a foretaste and at the same time a guarantee of our future inheritance (cf. 2 Corinthians 1:22; 5:5; Ephesians 1:13-14). Let us thus learn from Paul that the action of the Spirit directs our life towards the great values of love, joy, communion, and hope.
> (Pope Benedict XVI, 11/15/2006)

The actions of the Sprit guides us to great values. If you allow the Holy Spirit to act in you, it will move you to the great values.

# Romans 8

> [!quote]
> There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 
> 2 For the law of the Spirit[a] of life in Christ Jesus has set you[b] free from the law of sin and of death. 
> 3 For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 
> 4 so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 
> 5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.  
> 6 To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the  
> Spirit[g] is life and peace. 
> 7 For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law—indeed it cannot, 8 and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.  
> 9 But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not  
> belong to him. 
> 10 But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 
> 11 If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.
