# What are the synoptic gospels

Synoptic: Greek, (syn, "together") and (opsis, "see"). "Of the one sight"

Gospel: Eu-angelion = Good-News = Evangelio

The three synoptical gospels are telling you the same things about Jesus.

The three synoptic gospels are Mark, Matthew and Luke.

The proper material of a gospel is something that only one author saw.

Why not John?
	It is not a synoptic gospel, Jesus is seen in another way.

## Two-source theory: Mark and Q

The apostles proclaimed Jesus after his death resurrection, forming an oral tradition. The news spread. Then, people started collecting the oral tradition. The gospel of mark (55 a.C.) influenced Luke's gospels, and Matthew (65 a.C.) was influenced by "Q", a mystery.

Why was Jesus led to the desert:

> 32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.

What is the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit? Why will it not be forgiven?
	Because it is the Holy Spirit the one that forgives, if you blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, you block forgiveness.
