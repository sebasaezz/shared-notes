# The Pareclete
Paraclete = Advocate = _ad-vocatus_
Defender, the one that brings consolation,"The one who conforts".
The Holy Spirit is mentioned as the Paraclete by Jesus in the Last Supper.

> [!important] For the test

> 	She communicated the Holy Spirit. She knew because she was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
> Jesus, in the gospel of St john, names the holy spirit as teh paraclete ¿who, where and when names the HS as Paraclete?
> 	Not John, Jesus.

# The Holy spirit as the Pareclete in the gospel is St. John

## The Paraclete
Jesus named the Holy Spirit as Paraclete in the Gospel of john.
### 14:16-17 dwells in you

> [!quote]
> 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate [8](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXM.HTM#$3WR) to be with you always,
> 17 the Spirit of truth, [9](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXM.HTM#$3WS) which the world cannot accept, because it neither sees nor knows it. But you know it, because it remains with you, and will be in you.

The first use of the word Paraclete in the Bible. 
Why "Another"? 
Jesus was the first paraclete.

### 14.26 will teach and remember

> [!quote]
> The Advocate, the holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name - he will teach you everything and remind you of all that (I) told you.

The bible is inspired _in-spiritus_ by the Holy Spirit.
### 15.16 will testify

> [!quote]
> It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.

The Holy spirit procedes from the father and the son. As said in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan creed:

### 16.7 Jesus' departure was good

> [!quote]
> But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I go. For if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.

Why?
He will give us something that is similar to him (Holy Spirit) plus salvation.

### 16.13 will not speak on its own
> [!quote]
> [5](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXO.HTM#$3XE) But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth. He will not speak on his own, but he will speak what he hears, and will declare to you the things that are coming.
